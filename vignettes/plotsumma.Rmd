To plot inputs, outputs, and internal data flow

## SUMMA Input

Note the various macros within the `vignette` section of the metadata block above. These are required in order to instruct R how to build the vignette. Note that you should change the `title` field and the `\VignetteIndexEntry` to match the title of your vignette.

## SUMMA Output

There are several steps to getting a PDF containing plots of all SUMMA output variables

* Extracting the data from netCDF into a dataframe that is suitable for plotting: `sumdata_all <- temporaloutputdata('vault/benchmarking/PNW_3L_1H.nc', 1)`
* Converting the data 
* Plotting the data
